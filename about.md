Hi! I am a senior CS major with a minor in Web Programming @NYU. 

### More Information

I am currently working as a research assistant in data science at some NYU lab. I am planning to pursue a master’s degree in CS or a related field after I graduate. I enjoy learning new languages, both natural and programming languages. I am a big fan of magical realism and dystopian literature, Gabriel García Márquez & George Orwell are my favorites. I am bad at video games but still love them (got rejected by Nintendo once, will try again in the future).
