## Project Evaluation
During the project evaluation activity this week, our group was assigned [OpenEMR](https://www.open-emr.org/) , an open source software for electronic medical records and medical practice management as the project to be evaluated. I have always been interested in the combination of Computer Science and Health Administration, so I was very excited to look into OpenEMR. We first looked at the website of the project. The website of OpenEMR is very well-organized, and we were able to easily find everything we needed on the navigation bar and the footer. The website offers 3 fully functional demos to give visitors an idea of what the software is like. I tried one of the demos and it was very well built. There is an active forum where members of the community (both developers and users) post their questions. The website also provides links to the official Slack chat and the unofficial Telegram chat. The “Docs” tab links to a separate [OpenEMR Wiki](https://www.open-emr.org/wiki/index.php/OpenEMR_Wiki_Home_Page) site where demos, manuals, development info, etc. can be found.
